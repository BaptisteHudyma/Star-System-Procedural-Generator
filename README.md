# Star-System-Procedural-Generator
Proceduraly generate a star system from a seed in C++.

I love studying the universe with maths and so after some lengthy researchs, I decided to use all my packaged informations to create a realistic star system generator.

The probabilities used in this program can represent an approximation of reality, or at least what we know of the universe yet.
Also I added modifications to include probable but not confirmed star types, like black dwarfs (that will probably exist in some billion years or so).

This program is a work in progress so some bugs can happen, specially for double star systems with giant stars.
