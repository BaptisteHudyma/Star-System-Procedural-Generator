# Star-System-Procedural-Generator
Proceduraly generate a star system from a seed in C++

## Intro
I love studying the universe with maths and so after some lengthy researchs, I decided to use all my packaged informations to create a realistic star system generator.

The probabilities in this program are quite close to reality, or at least what we know of the universe yet.
Also certain probabilities are changed to add probable but not confirmed star types, like black dwarf (that will probably exist in some hundred million years or so)

This program is a work in progress so some bugs can happen, specially for double star systems with giant stars.

This is the main component of a 3D procedural physic based universe engine
