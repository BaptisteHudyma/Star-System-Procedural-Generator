# Star-System-Procedural-Generator
Proceduraly generate a star system from a seed
I love studying the universe by the maths and so after some long research, I decided to use all my stuff to create a realistic star system generator.

The probabilities in this program are quite close to reality, or at least what we now of universe yet.
Also certain probabilities are changed to had probable but not certain star types, like black dwarf (that will probably exist in some million years or so)

This program is a work in progress so some bugs can happend, specially for double star systems
